# H2PC-structure-learning
H2PC bayesian network structure learning implementation on Python

This mini-project aims to implement and test the H2PC
 algorithm, a method for structure learning in the con
text of Bayesian Network. The algorithm is compared to
 the state-of-the-art Max-Min-Hill-Climbing(Tsamardi
nos, Brown, and Aliferis 2006).
 The implementation is done with Python and the PyA
grum library.
 The visual representation of the networks and tests are
 generated with PGMPY and Graphviz libraries.
 The results show that H2PC is able to build a more
 accurate Bayesian Network structure compared to the
 rival; in particular this implementation shows an ex
tremely low false-positive edge ratio and good perfor
mance even with a small fraction of the dataset avail
able.
